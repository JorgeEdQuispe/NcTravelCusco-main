                                    Cusco was the capital of the great Inca culture. Due to its majesty, it has been
                                    considered the <strong>"Archaeological Capital of America"</strong> and is also
                                    considered a cultural heritage of humanity. Its name probably comes from a Quechua
                                    word Qusqu or Qosqo which means center or navel because, according to Inka
                                    mythology, the world below (Uku pacha) converged with the visible world (Kay pacha)
                                    and the upper world (Hanan pacha).<br><br>

                                    In this way, the city was and is called the navel of the world, in reference to the
                                    universe. However, no modern Quechua language contains this name associated with the
                                    aforementioned meaning.

                                    The ancient capital of the Inca empire is currently known as Cusco or Cuzco. It is
                                    something that causes confusion and we are going to briefly explain the origin of
                                    this difference. The word Cusco is the most used for Spanish speakers, however, for
                                    Anglo-Saxons the most used expression is Cuzco.<br><br>

                                    According to the researchers, the correct form should be Cuzco, because it is the
                                    closest thing to what the city was originally called. With the arrival of the
                                    Spaniards, the word used to refer to the city was Cuzco, so that they tried to
                                    pronounce the name of the city in that way. However, the elites in Cusco tried to
                                    suppress Spanish traces for decades, eliminating said word in 1976. In addition, in
                                    1993 the Quechua word Qosqo (meaning navel of the world or center of the universe)
                                    was added and later it returned to its meaning. who saw Cusco as a ritual
                                    center.<br><br>

                                    For this reason, its surroundings are impressive, given the devotion they had for
                                    nature and their gods. As a conclusion, both words are accepted. The most used and
                                    accepted by the local people of that region is Cusco, however for English speakers
                                    the most used is Cuzco. The height of Cusco Peru is 3,399 meters above sea level.

                                    is the "historical capital" of the country.<br><br>

                                    The city, according to the INEI, is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017
                                    it had a population of 437,538 inhabitants. It was formerly the capital of the Inca

                                    colonial era, under the sovereignty of the Spanish crown, various churches,
                                    universities, palaces and baroque and neoclassical squares were built.<br><br>

                                    These constructions are the attractions that make the city the main tourist
                                    destination in the country. It was declared a National Historical Monument in 1972
                                    and a World Heritage Site in 1983 by UNESCO. And it is often called, due to the
                                    large number of monuments it has, the “Rome of America”.

                                    The Inca kings, sons of the Sun, governed a vast empire, the Tahuantinsuyo, whose
                                    center was Qosqo, which means "navel". And this city was truly the center of the
                                    empire, from which the roads leading to the four "parts of the universe"
                                    started.<br><br>

                                    Below we present a brief summary of the main stages of the history of Cusco, but
                                    first we want to invite you to get to know it in the first person. There are two
                                    legends about the foundation of Cusco and both are based on a mythical
                                    journey.<br><br>
                                    <h4>Mythological foundation</h4>
                                    LThe first legend has Manco Cápac and Mama Ocllo as protagonists, children of Inti,
                                    the Sun god, and Quilla, the Moon goddess. The brothers set out from Isla del Sol,
                                    on Lake Titicaca, in search of a place to found a city. The chosen place was the one
                                    where the golden rod that they carried with them was stuck in the ground with a
                                    single blow.<br><br>

                                    In the second legend 'Legend of the Ayar brothers' the protagonists are four
                                    brothers, companions of four sisters: Mama Guaco and Ayar Cachi, Mama Cora and Ayar
                                    Uchu, Mama Rawa and Ayar Aucca, Mama Ocllo and Ayar Manco. They survived the flood
                                    caused by Wiracocha and came out of some caves in Pacaritambo, on the Tampu Tocco
                                    hill, to repopulate the Earth.<br><br>

                                    Due to different circumstances, three of the brothers abandoned the trip before
                                    reaching their destination. Only Mama Ocllo and Ayar Manco continued traveling until
                                    they found the place where the golden rod that Wiracocha had given them sank into
                                    the ground.<br><br>

                                    Manco used his abilities and linked the sun so that it would not set, thus creating
                                    the city in a single day. The city was called Qosqo and the rock from which he
                                    linked to the sun, in Machu Picchu, was baptized as Intihuatana.<br><br>

                                    In the center of the new city, designed in the shape of a recumbent puma, Manco
                                    erected a temple in honor of the Sun god and surrounded the city with mountains, to
                                    protect it from the wind, dominated by his brother Ayar Aucca. He also organized the
                                    first corn fields. Ayar Manco changed his name to Manco Capac. He is considered the
                                    first Inka, that is, the first king of the empire.<br><br>

                                    Around 1200 AD a lordship arose in the Valley of Cusco that dominated, over time,
                                    the rest of the towns. The person responsible for the creation of this empire was
                                    Cusi Yupanqui, the 9th Capac Inka and 1st Inka of Tahuantinsuyo, recognized as such
                                    around 1438. He was named Pacha Kutiy or Pachacútec Yupanqui Cápac Intichuri and
                                    crowned with the mascapaicha, imperial crown.<br><br>

                                    During the period of expansion, the two original regions or theirs, Huri (above) and
                                    Hanan (below) became four: Chinchaysuyo, Antisuyo, Qollasuyo and Kuntisuyo, and also
                                    included the peoples that were conquered in the 100 years that the expansion period
                                    lasted. empire.<br><br>

                                    The territory of the Inca Empire extended from the south of Colombia to the center
                                    of Chile and the northwest of Argentina, with a center in Cusco. In this time of
                                    splendor, mythical cities were built, such as Machu Picchu; 23,000 kilometers of
                                    road, among which is the famous Camino del Inca route; artificial irrigation
                                    channels with amazing technology, such as those that can be seen in Moray;
                                    fortresses, pyramids and temples.<br><br>
                                    <h4>The Spanish conquest - Fall of the Empire</h4>
                                    By the time Francisco Pizarro arrived in Cusco in 1532, the empire was weakened by a
                                    bloody civil war. This would explain why an army of less than 200 men was able to
                                    conquer and subdue an empire that had, at that time, around 15 million
                                    inhabitants.<br><br>

                                    The confrontation between the Inca Tupac Kusi Wallpaq (Huascar) and his brother
                                    Atahualpa ended with the triumph of the latter, who locked Huascar in prison. In
                                    November 1532 Atahualpa was summoned to a meeting with Pizarro in the city of
                                    Cajamarca, which the Inca attended with his unarmed troops, without suspecting that
                                    it was an ambush. Allied with enemies of Atahualpa, Pizarro and his hosts killed a
                                    large part of the Incas and arrested Atahualpa. From prison, the Inca king ordered
                                    the death of his brother.<br><br>

                                    Emperor Atahualpa promised the Spanish a large ransom for his release: two rooms
                                    filled with silver and one with gold. Precious metals arrived from all corners of
                                    the Empire during the nine months of the king's captivity. But, although the ransom
                                    was paid, Atahualpa was executed in July 1533 and the gold and silver were sent in
                                    part to Spain, and part distributed among Pizarro's soldiers.<br><br>

                                    Pizarro left for Cusco and on the way he was met by Manco Inca Yupanqui, whom he
                                    named the new king, with the intention of ruling the city through his ally. Together
                                    they entered the city in November 1533. In March 1534 Pizarro founded the Spanish
                                    "very noble and very loyal city of Cuzco".<br><br>

                                    The Spanish troops were greeted with joy, due to an ancient prophecy that the Inca
                                    gods would come to earth from the water. Their strange weapons, their appearance and
                                    their horses convinced the Incas that they were truly gods.<br><br>
                                    <h4>The rebellion of Manco Inca</h4>
                                    In 1536 Manco Inca, having seen what the true intentions of the Spanish were, began
                                    an uprising against them that would last 37 years. The first confrontation, in
                                    Acsayhuamán, culminated in the Spanish victory.<br><br>

                                    Pizarro first and his followers later, were achieving allies among different peoples
                                    of the empire. In 1538, with his troops exhausted and decimated, Manco Inca took
                                    refuge in Vilcabamba, where he established the seat of the Inca monarchy, while the
                                    Spanish continued to advance and dominate the cities of the empire.<br><br>

                                    Also between the Spaniards there were clashes. Diego de Almagro, having failed in
                                    the conquest of Chile, went to Peru in search of gold, where he faced Gonzalo
                                    Pizarro and Alfonso de Alvarado first, and Hernando Pizarro later, who defeated him.
                                    The group called "almagrista" was the one that assassinated Francisco Pizarro in
                                    1541.<br><br>

                                    The Viceroyalty of Peru was established in 1542 and Cusco became the most important
                                    city after Lima. The Inca rebellion ended in 1572, when Inca Tupac Amaru I, son of
                                    Manco Inca, was executed in Cusco by order of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo. His
                                    descendants were exiled to distant places to prevent further rebellions.<br><br>

                                    However, in 1780 a new uprising would take place, the so-called "Great Rebellion",
                                    this time for the independence of Peru, led by a descendant of Tupac Amaru, the
                                    caudillo José Gabriel Condorcanqui, known as Tupac Amaru II. Condorcanqui was
                                    imprisoned and later tortured and executed by the Spanish, along with his wife and
                                    his children and his followers, in the Plaza de Armas of Cusco, in 1781. The
                                    independence of Peru would finally come in 1821.<br><br>
                                    <h4>Colonial Cuzco</h4>
                                    The Spanish occupation of Cusco produced a drastic change not only in religion,
                                    customs and rituals, but also in architecture. Many temples and houses were simply
                                    destroyed to use the stone for colonial construction. Others were used as "bases" on
                                    which to erect churches, chapels and residences for the conquerors. On what was the
                                    Royal Palace of the Inca Viracocha, for example, the Cathedral of Cusco was built.
                                    Houses were even built in the space of the Plaza de Armas, considerably reducing it
                                    in size.<br><br>

                                    An earthquake in the year 1650 left the city practically in ruins. The
                                    reconstruction was done in a colonial style, with special emphasis on wood carving
                                    decoration, as can still be seen in various chapels and churches in the
                                    region.<br><br>

                                    The importance of Cusco, beyond tourism, lies in the historical significance of this
                                    city. The Incas never totally abandoned their traditions and tried to pass them down
                                    from generation to generation. After the death of Condorcanqui, resistance became
                                    the hallmark of Cusco. The history of this town, its gods and its heroes, is still
                                    told in its fabrics, for those who know how to read it.

                                    <h4>6. Archaeological Complex of "Choquequirao"</h4>
                                    It is located in the Cusco Region, and is made up of nine sectors, among which are:
                                    the political-religious center, the system of fountains and channels with aqueducts,
                                    and the group of the portals.<br><br>

                                    It is necessary to emphasize the religious character of this complex. The
                                    architecture is distributed around an esplanade or main square, and is complemented
                                    by a very well preserved system of agricultural terraces. The archaeological remains
                                    are distributed in the descending part of the Choquequirao hill and are grouped in
                                    the form of small neighborhoods, somewhat separated from each other, following a
                                    probable criterion of fusion and social rank.
                                    <h5>The residential sector and the terraces</h5>
                                    The residential area is found in the descending part, while the flanks of the
                                    mountains contain the agricultural terraces. Some of them had irrigation canals and
                                    were used permanently, while others were, when they perished, temporary.
                                    <h5>The ceremonial area</h5>
                                    The ceremonial area is located in the part called the Main Square, while a series of
                                    sophisticated buildings stand out in the upper part.<br><br>

                                    Visitors who arrive at Machu Picchu through the alternate route through
                                    Hydroelectric have the option of relaxing in the thermal baths of Cocalmayo. This
                                    natural attraction is located in the town of Santa Teresa, approximately 20
                                    kilometers from Machu Picchu.<br><br>

                                    The thermal waters of Cocalmayo have up to 3 pools with temperatures from 38ºC. up
                                    to 44ºC. Its waters are clear and have healing and relaxing properties. Many
                                    tourists arrive there on their way to Machu Picchu in order to relax.<br><br>

                                    <h4>8. Main Square Cuzco</h4>
                                    Known by the inhabitants of the time as Plaza Aucaypata, which in Quechua means
                                    "Plaza del Guerrero", it was one of the most important settings for the Incas who
                                    carried out tremendous festivities such as the Inti Raymi. Its beauty stands out
                                    thanks to the beautiful setting provided by its two-story stone arches, a work
                                    developed with the arrival of the Spanish in Peru.<br><br>

                                    This point of the city of Cusco is full of restaurants, museums and colonial
                                    churches, built where the Incas once buried their ancestors. It hides countless
                                    stories about ancient and modern culture in its streets.<br><br>
                                    <h4>9. Ollantaytambo </h4>
                                    Considered the <strong>"living Inca people"</strong>; This town welcomes us with the
                                    mystery that
                                    encloses its Inca ancestors, intact houses, in which time does not seem to have
                                    passed, various ecological floors, Inca terraces and food reservoirs, and the Inca
                                    bridge on the way to Pachar.<br><br>

                                    Also noteworthy are the pink granite monoliths assembled with impressive perfection
                                    and the Fortress of Ollantaytambo, a military building made up of carved stone
                                    terraces whose purpose, like that of other fortresses of the same nature, was to
                                    protect the empire from another angle. In this area we will also appreciate other
                                    monuments such as Mañaraucay, the Incahuatana and the Baños de la Princesa.<br><br>

                                    But the main attraction of this region is its tradition and people. As if suspended
                                    in time and dressed in the traditional way, we will go back to the Inca ancestors,
                                    sharing with the local guide and the communities myths, legends and customs that
                                    will paint us the panorama of a powerful and mystical empire.<br><br>

                                    <p><strong>Date: Every Sunday in February.</strong></p>
                                    Carnivals are a festivity that came to our country with the Colony and they are very
                                    colorful events where water and joy are always present. Each region, province and
                                    district of our Peru has its way of celebrating them and in Cusco the Andean
                                    traditions are mixed with this festival brought from the West.<br><br>

                                    The Cusco Carnival has a movable date, although it usually takes place between the
                                    months of February and March. In this carnival in this part of the country, the
                                    tradition of other Peruvian towns is followed where one week is set aside for the
                                    “Compadres” and another for the “Comadres”. The way of celebrating this week for
                                    some and others is typical and original in Cusco, during these weeks, in the first
                                    week the comadres visit the compadres, they are entertained by the women, but at the
                                    same time they are victims of many jokes that these they do to them, the following
                                    week the same thing will happen, only in reverse. In these carnival ceremonies of
                                    entertainment there is a constant and traditional dish that is served, it is the
                                    stew or timpu.<br><br>

                                    corsicans where the different towns face each other with the great color of their
                                    floats, clothing and dances, the latter that allow the traditions of this Peruvian
                                    region to be kept in force and among which are they find the Carnival of

                                    <h3>2. Religious festival in honor of the Lord of the Earthquakes of Cusco</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Date: Holy Mondays, which are normally every first Monday of the month of
                                            April</strong></p>
                                    The Taytacha de los Temblores (Saint of the Tremors in the Quechua language) is one
                                    of the most important religious images of Cusco. It is an effigy of Jesus Christ
                                    crucified that has a dark complexion. The Lord of the Tremors is considered the
                                    'Sworn Patron of Cusco'. The image stopped a plague in the city after being carried
                                    in a procession. Likewise, when the city was devastated by earthquakes, the
                                    inhabitants of Cusco begged the image to stop the misfortunes. It was thus that he
                                    was known as 'The Lord of the Tremors'.<br><br>

                                    Since then and for many years, the image is venerated in the Cathedral of Cusco. It
                                    is carried in procession every 'Holy Monday' in the midst of a large crowd of
                                    parishioners. The procession of the 'Taytacha de los Temblores' is characterized by
                                    religious manifestations as well as a tasting of Cusco cuisine.<br><br>

                                    <h3>3. The day of the Pachamama</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Date: Every first of August</strong></p>
                                    Cada 1 de agosto en todos los pueblos andinos de Perú, Bolivia, Ecuador y Argentina
                                    celebran el ‘Día de la Pachamama’. Esta celebración de origen inca revalora el culto
                                    a la ‘Madre tierra’, una entidad sagrada de quien creían que tiene vida y rige sobre
                                    la vida de la población.<br><br>

                                    En Cusco ese día se realizan los llamados ‘Pagos a la tierra’. Estas ceremonias
                                    tienen sus orígenes en la época incaica. Se trata de un ritual de agradecimiento a
                                    la ‘Pachamama’, en el cual se ofrendan hojas de coca, chicha, maíz y otros productos
                                    andinos.<br><br>

                                    Si bien los ‘Pagos a la tierra’ suelen realizarse en las altas montañas, también es
                                    posible realizarlo en casa. Estos rituales son realizados por un brujo o ‘chamán’
                                    que posee un conocimiento sobre el ritual transmitido por su familia. Los turistas
                                    también pueden participar del ‘Día de la Pachamama’ mediante paquetes turísticos que
                                    incluyen ceremonias de ‘Pago a la tierra’.<br><br>

                                    through the streets of Cusco to finally retire each one to their respective Church
                                    (14 in total where they came from).<br><br>

                                    In this festival there is no discrimination of race or social class because everyone
                                    has the right to attend and pay devotion to their patron or saint.<br><br>

                                    <h3>5. Lord of Qoyllority in Cusco</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Date: Starts on May 14 and lasts 47 days</strong></p>
                                    The Lord of Qoyllority is a Christ, whose image is drawn on a rock. He is a
                                    Christian-Andean divinity that is worshiped in the Cusco region and that annually
                                    gathers a group of people to its location in the Cordillera Vilcanota.<br><br>

                                    Translated into Spanish "Lord of the Brilliant Snow", this man, according to the
                                    traditions of the town, would have appeared years ago in the form of a child to
                                    another indigenous child in the area. It is said that the baby Jesus came disguised
                                    as a poor child and both little ones became friends. It is said that when the child
                                    returned home, the parents saw him and the child dressed in rich clothing, and
                                    seeing the brilliance of the Child Jesus, they informed the local priest who decided
                                    to go in search of him. The legend says that the child Jesus fled being persecuted
                                    by the priest who was unable to capture him because the child Jesus then became the
                                    image of the rock to which pilgrimage is currently made.<br><br>

                                    In this celebration, the residents who come to offer offerings come from different
                                    parts of Cusco, making extensive unstoppable walks, the date of the pilgrimage is
                                    not exact, but those who do it always keep it in mind since it follows the Andean
                                    calendar and occurs between the months of May and June. In this route it is not
                                    surprising the presence of processions together with fireworks, as well as the
                                    presence of wings, the latter are important since they are miniature crafts, those
                                    represent different things, including houses, cars, cattle, etc. and people acquire
                                    them by responding to a ritual, since it is believed that if you have these
                                    miniatures, at some point, you will also be able to obtain the different objects in
                                    real sizes in the same way.<br><br>

                                    <h3>6. Inti Raymi in Cusco</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Date: Every year on June 24.</strong></p>
                                    The Inti Raymi is a traditional celebration in Cusco that brings together many
                                    visitors, not only from the different regions of Peru, but from the world and that
                                    symbolizes in itself the maximum festivity of the sun, not in vain its translation
                                    into Spanish results in "Fiesta of the sun".<br><br>

                                    The current Inti Raymi celebration takes place every June 24 in the City of Cusco,
                                    specifically in the ancient Inca Fortress of Sacsayhuamán. The ceremony is a
                                    religious celebration in the manner of the Inca tradition in which a representative
                                    of the Inca along with different representatives of the four of his own and
                                    emblematic figures of the ancient empire, make an appearance in the wide court of
                                    the aforementioned fortress.<br><br>

                                    Continuing with the celebrations, the viewer will also be able to appreciate
                                    different rituals such as the chicha de jora, along with what could be called the
                                    most important: The sacrifice of a llama, something truly impressive on the dates
                                    since it consists of ripping out the heart still beating to the auquénido. This last
                                    ritual is carried out by an Inca priest who requests the presence of the animal on
                                    the usnu (or altar), the sacrifice is important for the tradition since the viscera
                                    and the blood of the sacrificed animal are necessary elements to be able to know the
                                    future. that it holds for the people and if the Sun will favor it.<br><br>
                                    <h3>7. Annual festivity of the Q'eswachaka Bridge</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Date: Every year on the second Sunday of June.</strong></p>
                                    The peasant communities near the town of Q'ehue celebrate the reconstruction of the
                                    Inca bridge of Q'eswachaka every year. This rustic construction is one of the last
                                    hanging Inca bridges that are still used in Peru.<br><br>

                                    Every year, both men and women from the Huinchiri, Chaupibanda, Ccollana, Q'ehue and
                                    Pelcaro communities work as a team for four days to replace the old Inca bridge with
                                    a new one. The works are accompanied by music, dance and typical dishes from
                                    Cusco.<br><br>

                                    The reconstruction of the Inca bridge is a very popular tourist event. Many visitors
                                    are encouraged to cross the Inca suspension bridge suspended 30 meters above the
                                    Apurimac River. The Q'eswachaka Bridge was considered a "Cultural Heritage of
                                    Humanity" by UNESCO in 2013.<br><br>

                                    people each year.<br><br>

                                    <h3>9. Santuranticuy</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Date: Every year on December 24.</strong></p>
                                    One of the cultural expressions typical of Cusco is, without a doubt, the
                                    costumbrista festival of Santuranticuy ('Sale of Saints' in the Quechua language).
                                    This festival is celebrated every December 24 through an art fair where images of
                                    virgins, saints and other Christian figures with Andean characteristics are sold.
                                    <br><br>

                                    This traditional celebration takes place in the Plaza de Armas of Cusco, which is
                                    filled with people including artisans, local residents and tourists. In Cusco it is
                                    a tradition that each family has its own saints or virgins of different sizes.
                                    During the Santuranticuy these people come to repair their religious images or renew
                                    them.<br><br>

                                    Among the most important religious images of Cusco, the so-called 'Children
                                    Manuelitos' stand out, handicrafts with characteristics of the 'Child Jesus'. That
                                    day paintings, ceramics, souvenirs and even typical dishes of Cusco are also
                                    offered. At night, Cusco families enjoy a succulent Christmas dinner.
